RightTriangle class design activity

Write a java class called RightTriangle that extends the abstract Shape class that we wrote in class. The following private properties should be defined for the RightTriangle class:

private int x
private int y
private int width
private int height
private double hypotenuse

Note that x and y refer to the x and y coordinates of the upper left corner of the right triangle.

Next, include the following in the class:

1. Write a 2 argument constructor with parameters for width and height. You should also calculate and initialize the hypotenuse using the width and height.

2. Write getter methods for the x and y properties. Write a single setter method to set both the x and y properties.

3. Write getters and setters for the width and height properties. Note that whenever the width and height are changed, the hypotenuse should be recomputed.

4. Write a getter method for the hypotenuse property. There should not be a public setter method for the hypotenuse.

5. Override the area() and perimeter() methods of the Shape class

6. Write a method toRectangle() that returns a Rectangle object with the same x, y, width, and height as this RightTriangle object.
